It's time to say hello, or maybe already too late...cause I'm so lazy.

I'm an accountant/controller/BI consultant/gourmand/music fan/... but never a web developer.

Many thanks to :boy: [Lock](http://liukai.link), who always inspires me in learning new things :raising_hand:. And I started web learning with him, now I feel here would be a nice place for me to record all the experiences of my slash roles.

Heaven
