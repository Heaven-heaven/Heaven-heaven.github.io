It's time to say hello, or maybe already too late...cause I'm so lazy.

I'm an accountant/controller/BI consultant/gourmand/music fan/Product manager... but never a web developer.

Many thanks to Lock, who always inspires me in learning new things. And I started web learning with him, now I feel here would be a nice place for me to record all the experiences of my slash roles.
